# Spotify Web App
- Currently, it takes user input and returns a list of songs/artists. 
- Users can choose if they want stats on artists or tracks, the time period for the stats, and a limit on how many songs/artists to return.
- Additionally, users can sort the results by their top artists/tracks or by the artists/tracks world popularity.
- Users can also make a playlist of a list of tracks and they can view additional stats like average tempo, average danceability, and average energy.

## To-do:
- My work blocks Spotify web player, so I'd like to implement a page where I can listen to music from my phone but I can see what's playing, skip/go back, and pause/play from my laptop so I don't have to pull my phone out all the time.
- A playlist creator where a user can enter five songs and the app will create a new playlist for them based off those songs.
